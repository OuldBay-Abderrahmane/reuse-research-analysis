Ceiling of the entrance hall to the former Brussels headquarters of Générale de Banque. Please note due to the specificity of this unique product we need a one week delay in order to properly prepare your order. These suspended structure was used by celebrated Belgian designer Jules Wabbes in a wall-to-wall set up to hide all technical devises such as ventilation grills, lighting devises, smoke detectors, etc. Resembling bank notes hanging from the ceiling, the surface was referred to as  'mille feuille'. The system consists of a primary suspended structure, profiles that are placed parallel every 1,6 meter. The secondary elements consist of lighter profiles with the characteristic little metal plates attached. The height of the total setup is 17cm, but at least 20cm needs to be planned to facilitate hanging. The height for optional lighting devises needs to be added to this, but can be kept to a minimum when using LED panels. Any given horizontal surface can be clad with this material, the secondary profiles can easily be cut. However, the ceiling cannot be used for vertical cladding. Price per square meter. Update 29/04/22: 66 sqm are still available in stock

Consists of tiles that were damaged in the demount or cleaning process. They can be used kept in one piece, in a traditional pattern with a more rustique look, or they can be broken and used in a ""trencadis"" floor applications. Also very beautiful for table and bar tops.

The tiles are clean from any mortar. Available colours depend on what we are processing that moment. Only on sale in our physical shop.

For installation, use of a (thicker) mortar layer is preferable over the use of a thinner tile glue. Because tile glue is only 1 to 2mm thick, it does not allow for the evening out of tiles of different thicknesses. If only tiles of the exact same thickness are used, glue could be feasible.

Batch of Marbrite wall tiles from ‘Verreries de Fauquez’ and decorative glass elements (+/- 18 sqm)These glass tiles in ‘Marbrite’, have been produced between 1924 and 1940 with a special technique developed by the ‘Verreries de Fauquez’ in Belgium. Marbrite, –  texture and pattern remind of marble – is a luxurious and precious material that was used as wall or ceiling cladding in many Art Deco buildings.These specific Marbrite tiles are identical to those on the ceiling of  ‘La Chapelle de Verre‘ (Fauquez).The story of the ‘Verreries de Fauquez’,  is marked by Arthur Brancart, who directed the company from till 1932. Inspired by the ‘Partie des Ouvriers Belges’, he sets up a number of facilities for the workers such as a bakery, butcher shop,  schools, and a party hall (marked with the slogan “Bien Travailler Bien S’amuser” in ivory letters). Housing is free for the company workers. Noteworthy are also the  “Caisse de secours et de Prévoyance du Personnel ou l’organisation”, a healthcare system for the workers of the company that is financed trough contributions by all workers. Brancart also sets up a joint purchase group for potatoes and coal, resulting in cheaper prices for his workers.

Granulo Šyl is a mineral undercoat that is characterized by a quartz grain and is used in particular for exterior renovation work.

It offers excellent adhesion on old paint and can be used to fill small cracks (< 1mm).

Granulo Šyl can be used as a primer before applying Šyl Out and Šyl In silicate paints or smoothing plaster (ref. 8320) or ArchiKal 900 plaster (ref. 8305).

The main component of Granulo Šyl is a mixture based on sodium silicate. Granulo Šyl is permeable to water vapour and has a neutral odour.

Its adhesion is increased by silicatisation on mineral substrates, but can also be used on non-mineral substrates.

871,871,013FUR005,Wall book shelf by Moens (Snead) from 'Book Tower' by Henri Van de Velde (ca. 1936) - 10 shelves,50.00,kg,pc,"
Lacquered steel shelves salvaged in Henri Van De Velde’s Book Tower in Ghent. The shelves have been produced by Moens under licence of SNEAD based in Louisville, Kentucky. These shelves closely resemble the first shelves produced for the opening of the library in 1937, but have probably been manufactured later. Angus Snead Macdonald and the company he founded revolutionised library design in the USA and the rest of the world. Their designs were crucial in moving the library system from one of closed, structural stacks, to open stacks that emphasise adjustability and which are still in use today. This shelf is made to be fixed on a wall. The product includes 2 side rails and 2 middle rails, 10 shelves (6 x W. 78 cm + 4 x W. 98 cm), 20 side shelves and 4 bookends. The shelves could be easily dismantled. Bolts and fixing screws for wall mounting are not included. Total height215 cmTotal width256,5 cmDepth29 cmGood used condition. There are some scratches, chipped paint, stickers and glue traces.

Their designs were crucial in moving the library system from one of closed, structural stacks, to open stacks that emphasize adjustability and which are still in use today. This shelving system was custom designed for the building and originally mounted on the ceiling and floor (see images in situ). More info about the worksite hereThe shelves are sold in parts and can be assembled according to your needs to create a modular shelving system (see pictures of the original unit combinations). The shelves were originally fixed in the concrete floor and on the ceiling. A custom mounting system (wall, standing, ceiling) and small adaptations will be needed depending on your interior project. We do not provide such accessories. This shelf can be attached on side rails or middle rails (rails are not included in this product, see other products bellow). The shelf can be mounted on both ends.Total height17 cmLength77 cmDepth26 cmGood used condition. There are some scratches, chipped paint and glue traces.

In February 2022, we acquired the content of the former workshop at the bankrupt Durobor plant in Soignies (Hainaut). We found plenty of glasses from different phases of the stemware manufacturing process. Some of them only have the body while others also have stem and base, but almost all of them have a specific lid on the rim. After the glass has been blown in the mold, the temperature has to cool down and the glass is still extremely fragile. In order for the machines to move the glasses around efficiently without risking damage, the glasses have a temporary lid attached to their rim. Then the glass bowl is turned upside down and the bottom is heated with a torch to attach a stem and a base. At the end of the process, the lid is cut and heated. Various sizes and shapes available in our physical shop, hand cleaned by our team. Sold per kg.
