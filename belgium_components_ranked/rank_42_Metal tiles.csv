69,69,69,999FLO124,Speckled grey tiles ‘ Welkenraedt ’ mm,28.0,kg,m2,"
Speckled grey tiles ‘Welkenraedt’.

Dimensions: 100 mm x 100 mm (+/- 1mm)
Thickness: 7 mm
1 sqm = 100 tiles

Very good used condition. The old mortar is completely removed using an acid bath (the tile itself is insensitive to acids). Some tiles may have a few scratches and very small chips.

Ready for installation, chip tolerance less than 5 mm. Tiles are dirty but can be easily cleaned with brush and soap after installation.

Visible color variation in tiles due to fabrication dates.
